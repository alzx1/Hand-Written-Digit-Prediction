Introduction
The Hand Written Digit Prediction - Classification Analysis project aims to demonstrate how to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict handwritten digits. It uses the MNIST dataset, which is a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository provides step-by-step instructions and code snippets to guide you through the process of analyzing the dataset, preprocessing the images, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

Dataset
The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, which is included in the sklearn.datasets module. The dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, with each image represented as a 28x28 grayscale array.

Installation
To run the notebook and experiment with the code, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/alzx1/Hand-Written-Digit-Prediction.git
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:

Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open the Hand Written Digit Prediction - Classification Analysis.ipynb notebook in Jupyter.

Usage
The notebook provides detailed explanations of each step involved in the classification analysis, including:

Data loading and exploration
Data preprocessing and feature scaling
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
Training different classification models (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machines)
Evaluating and comparing the model performance
Making predictions on new handwritten digits
Follow the instructions in the notebook cells to execute the code and observe the results. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different approaches or models.
