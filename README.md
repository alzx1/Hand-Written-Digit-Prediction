## Introduction

The Hand Written Digit Prediction - Classification Analysis project aims to demonstrate how to build a machine learning model that can accurately predict handwritten digits. It uses the MNIST dataset, which is a widely used benchmark dataset for image classification tasks.

The Jupyter Notebook in this repository provides step-by-step instructions and code snippets to guide you through the process of analyzing the dataset, preprocessing the images, training the model, and evaluating its performance.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the MNIST dataset, which is included in the `sklearn.datasets` module. The dataset consists of 70,000 images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, with each image represented as a 28x28 grayscale array.

## Installation

To run the notebook and experiment with the code, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
git clone https://github.com/alzx1/Hand-Written-Digit-Prediction.git


2. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
jupyter notebook


4. Open the `Hand Written Digit Prediction - Classification Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.

## Usage

The notebook provides detailed explanations of each step involved in the classification analysis, including:

- Data loading and exploration
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets
- Training different classification models (e.g., logistic regression, support vector machines)
- Evaluating and comparing the model performance
- Making predictions on new handwritten digits

Follow the instructions in the notebook cells to execute the code and observe the results. Feel free to modify the code and experiment with different approaches or models.
